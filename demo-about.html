          <h2>Culture of life vs. Culture of death</h2>
          <p>Some people are already solidly pro-life. Others are "pro-choice." Lets get this straight right now. Nobody who claims to be "pro-choice" is anything other than "pro-abortion." This web site will even help abortion supporters see why pro-abortion euphemisms like "pro-choice" are designed to confuse the public. Words are not always what they seem.</p>
          <p>Sometimes talking to pro-aborts can be like arguing with a post, but that doesn't mean we won't try! However, far too many people are simply confused and think that abortion may not be a good thing but sometimes it's the right answer. That is wrong and we will explain why.</p>
          <p>If you're solidly pro-life, we're here to give you the tools necessary to spread that genuine pro-life philosophy in your own community. Signing up for our updates nad newsletters is a great way to learn how you can make a difference.</p>
          <h2>Come and See</h2>
          <p>Perplexed? Come explore our site. Once you see why abortion isn't the answer even in extraordinary circumstances, other pro-life facts will also become clear. For example, you will understand why starvation is not the proper course to follow for someone diagnosed as "brain dead." You will agree that the foundational principles upon which pro-life integrity is based are the only way to fly.</p>
          <p>If you're pro-abortion then you shouldn't mind perusing our site. After all, we're going to change your mind right? If you believe it is a woman's right to kill a child then you shouldn't min reading up on abortion procedures. We're not going to debate with you: Abortion is murder, pure and simple. But, if you have a question, we will happily answer it for you.</p>
          <h2>Committed to life</h2>
          <p>American Life League has maintained this principled stand since its foundation in 1979. Yes, 1979 seems like a long time ago, but bedrock principles and Absolute Truth never change. And if you noted the reference to Pope John Paul, yer, American Life League is Catholic in its philosophy and identity. We work with everyone regardless of religious persuasion as we understand that the basic pro-life truth is applicable to all persons, in all situations.</p>
          <p>Who provides the financial support for our mission? People just like you. American Life League get no money from the government and no mega-dollar donation from huge philanthropic foundations. Our funding consists of modest gifts from regular folks who wish to join us in this mission. Consider a generous gift from the heart and out of the shared conviction that this is a message that must be spread. Join us, save a life, convert a wayward soul, make a straight path to the truth!</p>
